    C: A terrible photoshoped horse and a person riding on it
        Also a terrible photoshoped barrel and in the background a stead

    D: Two people on horses both topless riding in a desert.

    E: A desert with some green patches and a large valley

    F: A green field with a tractor on it

2. b): E: I visited the badlands desert in south dakota. 
        The desert was full of fossiles. The desert early was a large river and then there were some teconic shifts and the river bed dried out.
        Now it is eroding through sun and wind. 
        My father found a 5e-05 km large tooth in the desert.
        And it was so hot. I don't like heat, I'm more the winter person. But in the shadows (which were actually pretty much everyhwere because of the huge desert dunes) it was very plesently warm
        Put still the desert had its own beauty, with its roughness and it loneliness (also if it was pretty overfilled).In short it still had the desert vibes
