In my school we have a ton of rules, i mean of course we do it's a german school after all, but it all usually just boils down to:
    1. Kein Essen und drinken (ausser der lehrer gestattet es)
    2. Keine kaputzen oder sonsige kopfbedeckung (Religioese sind gestattet)
    3. Nicht den unterricht storen

In english:
    1. No food and no drinks in the class except the teacher allows it
    2. No hoody and no other head stuff like hats (religiouse are allowed)
    3. You are not supposed to be loud in classes and you are also not allowed to annoy the teacher

Most teachers will still allow you to drink in the class but some teachers
