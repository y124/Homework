I hate the nationalism in american schools. It's such an old thing. (and i say that as a american myself)

I also hate that school goes on until 3:17 pm (what for a stupid time).

    In my opinion i am learning more stuff that interests me when i am out of school, so that would mean i'd have less time for the stuff that interests me.

But what i do like is that the classes don't eat at the same time, because then the cantine would be less full.

Just in general i like the german education system more, but the americans have some neat stuff.
