I hate that nationalism in american schools. It's such an old thing. (and i say that as a american myself)

I also hate that school goes on until 3:17 pm (what for a stupid time).

    In my opinion i am learning more stuff that interests me out of school, so that would mean i'd have less time for the stuff that interests me.
