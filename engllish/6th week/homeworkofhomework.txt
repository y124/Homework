wb 55 nr. 5

Yes, i am.

Yeah, from germany. It's really awesome here.

It happens to the best of us :). I already said that i am from germany.

yeah, i am part of it. Btw did you ever meet our exchange teacher? She's really mean. 

Oh yeah, i totally love your school so much. The food in the cantine is so much better then in germany, but i think singing the national anthem is really weird. nationlaties is something so old, and only americans hold on to it.

Kaya: Yeah, you are right. It's really weird. I'm also not such a big fan of all of this nationalism.

Milan: What do you do in your free time?

Kaya: Oh, I, I... I browse alot on social media, and i also go river tubing in the river down that streat.

Milan: Oh that sounds so cool. I should also do that once, before we head back to germany. Maybe we can go togheter?

Kaya: Oh yeah sure. I think the next time I was planning on going, was in 2 days. I'll ask my parents if you can follow.



nr 6. 

many things are different in the USA in schools, when compared to germany.
E.g. Schools are much much much larger in the USA, and also much longer (ya know in time not in length). Evening school isn't rare in the USA.
But sometimes it's more clubs then evening school.

They also have slightly different subjects like US politics. Some schools even have houseworking and stuff like that.

Another really large difference is that kids have driving lessons in school. You can then drive the car (i think) with 14.

And most kids drive to the school on their own, which would never be thinkable in germany.
